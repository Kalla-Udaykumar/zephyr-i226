## Changes from DevOps team
  - Create a test job exactly same as another Zephyr IA job.
  - Create dev branch for all the jenkinsfile and build script.
  - Let developer have permission to make changes on the dev branch.
  - Optional â€“ if no permission: Use other repo which developer has access to upload the files and we clone those file into the job. 

## Developer Work
Devloper as to do following work

  - A test job they can trigger,  and scm.sh and build.sh files they can make changes.

  -  So, developer has a way to self-service the change the job based on what they need.
